# TriviaGame

This is a Trivia game that tests the user on 10 pokemon trivia questions.  It will display a gif depending on if the user is correct, incorrect or if the time is up.  The user gets a set amount of seconds to answer each question.  At the end, the screen will display the number of correct and incorrect answers the user has (counting the questions where the time runs out as incorrect).  The user will have the option to restart the game after it is finished.
